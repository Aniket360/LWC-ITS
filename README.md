ðŸš€ Project Highlight: LWC Interactive Testing System ðŸš€

Excited to share my latest project â€” an interactive quiz application built with Salesforce Lightning Web Components (LWC):
âœ… Real-time user interaction and scoring
âœ… Responsive and mobile-friendly UI
âœ… Applied Apex principles and component-driven development
âœ… Hands-on experience with Salesforce platform features
âœ… GitHub Link: github.com/Aniket360/LWC-ITS

Through this project, I deepened my skills in Salesforce development, LWC, Apex integration, and UI/UX best practices, preparing me for real-world Salesforce projects.
